# Off_to_the_Races
[Build Your Race! :horse:](https://gmyers95.github.io/Off_to_the_Races/)

## Overview  
<hr>
For this project, we wanted to create a model-based dashboard that enables users to make educated selections in order for "their horse" to finish at the desired position. The dashboard shows visualizations of each variable that goes into the model. Those variables being: Jockey(and jockey weight), race track, track turf, track condition, race class, and race number. Once a selection is made for each variable and the user clicks "Submit", the selected variables' coefficients are sent to the model equation, the equation outputs the predicted placement, and a race chart is shown that ends with the user's horse at the predicted placement.

## Data Extraction

(@Lija and Sofia)

## Backend



## HTML
The dashboard set-up of this project was done through the Bootstrap library (v5.3) as well as some plots embedded from Tableau and the racing chart from (racing library). The set of select menues all interact with the javascript file where the variables' coefficients are plugged in to the model's equation which sends the placement prediction back out to the frontend and triggers the racing chart. Carousels as well as static images are presented in order to give the user more information on the options they have for each select menu.

## Dashboard 

## CSS

One styles sheet was used for this dashboard which coordinated the sizing and colors of the finer details for the final look of the page.
