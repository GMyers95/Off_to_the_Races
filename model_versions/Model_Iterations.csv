3,-0.332611,"Joel Rosario, Eric Cancel, Manuel Franco, Dylan Davis, Reylu Gutierres",race_number,"race_date, latitude, longitude, trakus_index, program_number, distance_id, run_up_distance, purse, post_time, odds","One-hot encoding used, but didn't remove predicted values from predictive regression variables (also the case in above iterations)"
4,-0.256158,"Joel Rosario, Eric Cancel, Manuel Franco, Andre Shivnarie Worrie, Reylu Gutierres","track_id, race_number","race_date, latitude, longitude, trakus_index, program_number, distance_id, run_up_distance, purse, post_time, odds",Jockey swapped out and de-dupe feature added to produce more rows of data
5,0.05912,"Joel Rosario, Eric Cancel, Manuel Franco, Andre Shivnarie Worrie, Reylu Gutierres","track_id, race_number, race_date, jockey, program_number","race_date, latitude, longitude, trakus_index, program_number, distance_id, run_up_distance, purse, post_time, odds",De-dupe features added to produce more rows of data
6,0.59389,"Joel Rosario, Eric Cancel, Manuel Franco, Andre Shivnarie Worrie, Reylu Gutierres","track_id, race_number, race_date, jockey, program_number","race_date, latitude, longitude, trakus_index, program_number, distance_id, run_up_distance, purse, post_time, odds",Standaridizes data using standard scalar. Tests lasso and ridge regressions (multivariate linear regression still the best in terms of predicitve power).
